# keziashiny - DSA Python Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository! This repo contains Python solutions and examples for various coding problems and fundamental concepts.

## Files included

- `array_basics.py` — Basic operations and manipulations on arrays
- `best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py` — Solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem
- `big_o_examples.py` — Examples demonstrating Big O notation and time complexity
- `dsa.py` — General DSA practice code
- `evennum.py` — Code related to checking or generating even numbers
- `max_sum_subarray.py` — Solution for finding maximum sum subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)
- `two_sum.py` — Solution for the Two Sum problem

## About

This repository is part of my ongoing practice to strengthen my problem-solving skills in Python with DSA concepts. It helps me prepare for coding interviews and improve algorithmic thinking.

## How to Use

You can run these Python scripts locally with:

```bash
python filename.py
